              creating memorable dining experiences, we have grown into a

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Metro Bites</b> was born out of a love for food and a desire to
              create a space where people could connect over delicious meals.
              Our founder, Lakshmi Narasimha Reddy, envisioned a restaurant that
              not only serves food but also tells a story—each dish crafted with
              care, reflecting our culinary heritage and contemporary
              influences.
            </p>
